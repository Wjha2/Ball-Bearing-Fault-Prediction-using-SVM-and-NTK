# Ball-Bearing-Fault-Prediction-using-SVM-and-NTK
## üìå Overview
This project explores the use of **Support Vector Machines (SVM) with Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)** for predicting faults in ball bearings. Ball bearing failures can cause significant operational issues, and traditional fault detection methods often fall short due to data complexity. 

By leveraging NTK, which models the behavior of infinitely wide neural networks, we provide a robust kernel for SVM. This approach involves:

- **Preprocessing vibration signal data** üõ†Ô∏è
- **Splitting data into training and testing sets** üìä
- **Computing the NTK using a neural network architecture** üß†
- **Optimizing SVM hyperparameters via randomized search with cross-validation** üîç
- **Evaluating model performance on unseen data** ‚úÖ

## üöÄ Features

## üìå Discussion & Insights

### üí° Key Observations
1. **Linear Kernel performed the best** after hyperparameter tuning, achieving **97% accuracy**.
2. **RBF Kernel struggled significantly**, with an accuracy drop to **71%**, failing on certain classes.
3. **Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) was competitive** with **95% accuracy**, showing that deep kernel methods help in feature separation.
4. **Certain classes were harder to classify**:
   - **OR_021_6_1** was challenging for all models, indicating feature overlap.
   - **Ball_014_1 had almost 0% recall in RBF**, meaning it was often misclassified.

### üöÄ Recommendations
‚úÖ **For Best Performance:** Use **Linear Kernel SVM** with hyperparameter tuning (`C=100`).  
‚úÖ **If Deep Learning Methods Are Allowed:** NTK can be an alternative, as it generalizes well.
