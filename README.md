# Ball-Bearing-Fault-Prediction-using-SVM-and-NTK
## 📌 Overview
This project explores the use of **Support Vector Machines (SVM) with Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)** for predicting faults in ball bearings. Ball bearing failures can cause significant operational issues, and traditional fault detection methods often fall short due to data complexity. 

By leveraging NTK, which models the behavior of infinitely wide neural networks, we provide a robust kernel for SVM. This approach involves:

- **Preprocessing vibration signal data** 🛠️
- **Splitting data into training and testing sets** 📊
- **Computing the NTK using a neural network architecture** 🧠
- **Optimizing SVM hyperparameters via randomized search with cross-validation** 🔍
- **Evaluating model performance on unseen data** ✅

## 🚀 Features
- Uses **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** with **Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)**
- Handles vibration signal data for predictive maintenance
- Hyperparameter tuning via **randomized search with cross-validation**
- Provides improved fault detection for industrial applications
